# Deep Learning - Linear Regression, Perceptron and MLP

## Description
This mini-project was developed as the first homework for Deep Learning class.


## Installation
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## Training and Evaluation

### Image Classification with CNN 
First run:
```python3 download_fashin_mnist.py```

After it downloads the dataset you can run the "cnn.py" file, ex:
- python3 src/cnn.py

### Image Caption with Encoder-Decoder LSTM
Just run the "train" file, ex:
- python3 src/train.py
- python3 src/train.py --use_attention
